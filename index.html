                bio: "My name is Andrew Rose I enjoy reading, which helps me to grow spiritually and intellectually. I am passionate about sports especially track and field and soccer. I enjoy spending quality time with my family. I have been married for more than thirty years to my beautiful wife Brenda Rose and am a proud father of six children Quenton, Andrew Jr, Elijah, Jadon, Jalon and Ebony and my granddaughter Kehlani. My family has supported every step of my ministry journey, and I work every day to live a life of faith and integrity always seeking to contribute positively to those that are around me. It is important to me that my faith is seen not only in my words but in the way I live, and I hope my actions consistently honor God.\n\nFor twenty-five years I have been baptized in the 7th day church of God. I have had the privilege to be part of the Brampton Sabbath Keeping Ministries over the past 6 years. This church has been my home, my support, and the place where I have grown in my faith. Serving in different roles over the years has been one of the greatest honours of my life, and every opportunity has only strengthened my commitment to this ministry and the people in it.\n\nI currently serve as the Men’s Vice President, and this work has been deeply meaningful to me. I have seen how powerful it is when men support each other, grow spiritually, and take responsibility in their homes and in the church. Walking alongside them has strengthened my own faith and reminded me how important steady, dependable leadership is in our community.\n\nMy passion for youth development is evident as a Sabbath School Teacher, where I guide teens ages 13 to 17 with patience, understanding, and strong biblical principles.\n\nI am also thankful to be part of our Prison Ministry. Spending time with individuals who are searching for direction has shown me how much hope can mean to a person. Sharing God’s message with them has deepened my appreciation for grace and second chances. It has reminded me that every life has value, and that encouragement can reach people in ways we do not always see.\n\nOther roles include the Leader of the fundraising team where we seek opportunities to raise funds for the church and strategic planning. I am a part of the audit team where we ensure that compliance is met with the financial obligations of the church.\n\nMy career working in the financial sector over 20 years has also helps me to understand money management. I worked as a credit advisor and currently as a business advisor which has allow me to review business financials to evaluate and analyze strength and weakness of small business credit worthiness. My professional experience has deepened my understanding of money management, strategic planning, and financial integrity. I adhere strictly to the code of conduct that governs confidentiality and trust, principles that align closely with my approach to ministry and leadership.\n\nI am now putting myself forward to serve as a board member because I care deeply about the direction of our church and the well-being of our congregation. I want to continue giving my time, my experience, and my full commitment to the growth and unity of this ministry. I believe I can contribute in a meaningful and responsible way, and I would be honored to serve in this capacity."

                image: "Images/OB.jpeg",
                bio: "I was born in North York, Ontario, and raised by my parents, Deacon Edward Nichol and Sister Janet Nichol. From an early age, church has been a central part of my life, and most of my formative years in the faith were spent in Toronto.\n\nMusic became part of my life very early. I began studying piano at the age of five at the Royal Conservatory of Music, and after leaving the school, I continued to teach myself and explore other styles and genres. Through the church, I was blessed with the opportunity to learn how to play the organ, as well as hymns and choruses, under the guidance of Pastor W. B. Treleven. Those early teachings helped shape both my musical foundation and my spiritual growth.\n\nAs I served in my local church, I entered a season of learning, creativity, and personal soul-searching. About a decade later, when our headquarters church merged with our local branch, it marked a turning point in my life and ministry. During that time, God placed a clear idea on my heart—to create an Audio/Visual Ministry for our organization. That ministry began with six dedicated individuals, one of whom, Brother Junior D. James, has since passed on. His contribution and memory remain meaningful to me.\n\nAt the time, I was studying Broadcast Television and Audio Production at Seneca College at York, and my passion was to use media and technology to help spread the gospel beyond the walls of the church. I believed then—and still believe now—that what we have as a church is special and worth sharing with the world.\n\nSeventeen years ago, I was given the opportunity to assist the Brampton branch for what was meant to be a six-month commitment to support the music department. However, God had a different plan. I received a clear direction to remain in Brampton, to serve alongside Pastor Duff and the brethren, and to help build the church there. That decision became one of the most meaningful steps of my life.\n\nDuring my years at the Church of God Sabbath Keeping Ministries in Brampton, I have been blessed to help design and build our current church facility and to fully use the gifts God has given me in audio/visual production, music development, and media ministry. I currently serve as the Head of the Audio/Visual Department and also help oversee our music and social media ministries.\n\nOutside of church, I have spent approximately 15 years in the film and television industry, working on various productions, television shows, and films across Ontario and Canada. These experiences have further strengthened my ability to serve the church with excellence and professionalism.\n\nI have been part of the Church of God Sabbath Keeping Organization for over 30 years, with 17 of those years spent in the Brampton congregation. I truly believe that God is not finished with me yet, and that I still have more to give. As long as God grants me life and strength, my desire is to continue serving faithfully and to help guide our church into its next chapter."
